      <div class="meal-content">
        <div class="meal-title">1.Bananas</div>
        <div class="meal-desc">Bananas are a great source of natural sugars, simple carbohydrates, and potassium. In the body, potassium is only stored for a limited amount of time, so try consuming a banana around 30 minutes to an hour before your workout. Eating a banana as your pre-workout snack is the perfect way to boost your glycogen stores and increase blood sugar levels — you can add some peanut butter for that extra protein boost.</div>

          <div class="meal-title">2. Dry fruits</div>
          <div class="meal-desc">Dry fruits are a popular snack that many people enjoy for their delicious taste and nutritional benefits. They are a great source of vitamins and minerals and provide quick energy to help you power through the day.
  
              However, many people still determine the best time to eat dry fruits. Should they be consumed before or after meals? Is it better to eat them in the morning or at night?</div>

        <div class="meal-content">
          <div class="meal-title">3. Caffeine</div>
          <div class="meal-desc">Caffeine is renowned for improving exercise performance – enhancing a range of endurance-based tasks like running, cycling, swimming and rowing, plus increasing reps performed during resistance exercise4.
  
              Caffeine is known to enhance exercise performance by increasing utilisation of free fatty acids and reducing the breakdown of glycogen (carbohydrate energy stores), as well as making adaptations in the central nervous system.</div>

      <div class="meal-content">
        <div class="meal-title">4. Protein Bar</div>
        <div class="meal-desc">If you’re on the go and looking for a quick top-up before the gym, then a protein bar is a great option. There are lots of options out there, but in terms of a pre-workout snack, you want to fuel your workout as well as boost your protein intake. Look for one with some carbohydrates too to offer a good balance of energy. A Layered Bar would make a good pre-workout as it contains protein, contributing to muscle mass as well as carbohydrate that’ll have you trampling the treadmill for hours. The low-sugar content is an added bonus for those watching their waistlines too. Eat around an hour before you workout to optimise your workout energy.</div>

      <div class="meal-content">
        <div class="meal-title">5. Homemade Protein Bars</div>
        <div class="meal-desc">We listed pre-made protein bar options earlier, but if you’re into your baking, then give some homemade bars a go. Homemade protein bars are super easy to make and are top of the list for on-the-go pre-workout foods. What’s more, you can control the content making bars that are high in carbohydrates and protein or low in carbohydrates and high in protein. You can add everything from nuts and seeds to dried fruit and a sprinkle of chocolate — just watch the sugar content.</div>

        <div class="meal-content">
          <div class="meal-title">6. Beetroot</div>
          <div class="meal-desc">Beetroot and beetroot powder as a sports supplement has gained attention recently as a food that can enhance exercise performance.
  
              Beetroot contains a high level of nitrates, which increase blood flow to muscles – enhancing their efficiency during exercise3. Add beetroot powder or beetroot juice to your pre-workout shake around 60 minutes before exercise for best results.</div>
